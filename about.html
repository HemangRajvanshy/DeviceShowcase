								<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Operation</h2>
								<p>The machine is operated in a manner similar to a typical exercise bike; the user will sit on the seat and
									rotate the
									pedals using their legs. As the pedals are rotated, they spin an axle that is connected to a system of gears,
									progressively increasing the RPM generated by the user by a significant amount. The system outputs its
									rotational
									motion to a belt that is connected to an electric dynamo. We use a Shimano Alfine dynamo to convert the energy
									from
									pedaling into electric energy, thus the dynamo is highly efficient and requires virtually no maintenance.

								</p>
								<p>The Electricycle houses a WEN mini-generator battery that can store up to 2 kilowatt-hours energy which
									is just
									enough to
									store enough energy to power your home while being small enough to fit within the product's dimensions. The
									battery
									has a
									power output of 1000 watts, meaning that it can power forty 25-Watt light bulbs at once. The output from the
									Electricycle can be plugged directly into any device as it is very similar to the energy output from the U.S.
									power
									grid. On top
									of all of this, a wide, high-quality biking seat is attached to ensure comfort for long durations of
									usage. The
									make-up of our device creates a durable, long-lasting, and effective generator that has many different uses.</p>
								<p>The Electricycle can also pair with your mobile device via Bluetooth. Once paired, The Electricycle App can
									be
									used to
									control the bike, check the status of your battery, and track your workouts. The app can also provide these
									metrics
									over time and lets you track your workouts.</p>

							<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Follow The Energy</h2>
							<p>Since the primary purpose of designing this device is to reveal its energy inputs, it is important to also
								understand the transfer of energy that has to occur for this machine to operate and be functional. Let’s start
								following the path of the energy within this system when it is still in the form of calories in food. The
								chemical
								bonds within food are broken, converting the substances into more useful forms of energy for humans through a
								complex
								digestion process. One of the main purposes of digestion is to provide your cells with the necessary energy to
								operate
								through a molecular chemical called ATP. Humans can utilize this energy to partake in many activities; however,
								within
								our product, we attempt to harness human's ability to use their muscles to produce rotational motion by pushing
								pedals. The rotation of the Electricycle’s pedals will then turn a dynamo, producing electricity that may be
								stored,
								used, or transported elsewhere.
							</p>

							<p>Some of this electric energy will be used to power the Bluetooth module that enables communication with The
								Electricycle App, while the rest will be available for use through outlets on the bike’s rear. Unused energy is
								simply
								stored in the WEN mini-generator battery until it needed to power other devices at a later time. By
								understanding the
								bike's energy flow, we are better informed about the complex role energy truly plays in our lives.

								<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Influencing Behavior</h2>
								<p> One of the main aspirations we had while designing our product was to change the user’s perspective on
									energy and
									its influence on the world. People often interact with devices that obscure their energy inputs because their
									designers usually found it unnecessary to display these inputs, thus leading individuals to rarely question
									where
									their energy is even coming from. However, our product was developed with that goal of putting a strong
									emphasis on
									its energy inputs and conveying the importance of energy to its user. Multiple studies support our belief that
									cognitive and emotional behaviors are associated with physical actions. The action of performing some task can
									often
									lead an individual to either reinforce or alter, but unquestionably influence, their views concerning that
									task. With
									this idea in mind, the Electricycle was designed to change the user’s perspective towards energy by pushing
									them to
									realize how their labor directly relates to energy production fueling their device.
								</p>
								<p> As you pedal the Electricycle with unwavering determination, you can look at your daily workout statistics
									to
									better understand how your efforts equate to the energy consumption of several household products. By
									reviewing The
									Electricycle app, you will gradually begin internalizing the amount of energy you use every day. This product
									urges
									you to think about ways you can cut your power consumption all while the app frequently displays energy saving
									tips at
									the beginning of every session.</p>
