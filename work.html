								<p>Even though this product draws inspiration from a modern stationary exercise bike, we have sought to improve
									upon
									its design in order to bring greater utility to your home. One of the main functionalities of our device is
									that it
									allows you to generate power while pedaling, thus allowing to improve your health while powering your gadgets.
									A
									highly efficient electrical dynamo located within the bike converts your hard work to electricity that can
									either be
									stored in an internal battery or outputted through a rear outlet. The Electricycle also comes with its own
									mobile app
									which allows you to track your workouts, see how many calories your burned in each session and view how much
									electricity you have generated. In addition, the app presents you with information about how much energy the
									internal
									battery has
									as well as for how long you can power common household devices with the energy stored in the battery. </p>
								<p>
									In order to allow the bike to be used in a wide variety of locations in your home, the handlebars normally
									found on
									exercise bikes have been removed to allow you to pedal both in the gym as well as at a desk. This allows
									exercise and
									work to be combined together and facilitates productivity.
								</p>

								<p>By serving both as a generator and an exercise machine, The Electricycle will gradually make you aware of
									the
									influence electricity has on your life while helping you learn how your labor equates to the energy
									consumption of
									modern devices. By highlighting how energy moves and is transformed within our world, this device will develop
									your
									understanding of the true scale of your home's electricity usage. </p>

							<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Real World Applications</h2>
							<p>In addition to promoting your health and fueling your home, the Electricyle can also have highly practical
								functionality that could aid people facing more threatening situations. Our product's ability to generate
								electricity
								independent of the presence of a power grid makes this device extremely beneficial in regions affected by
								natural
								disasters or power outages. Although labor is involved in the power generation process, individuals with no
								alternative sources of electricity could potentially use pedaling as a way to charge their devices. Individuals
								in a
								power outage could power their gadgets through pedaling without the need to purchase an expensive generator or
								relocate. A family could quickly create enough energy to power the necessary devices to call for help, get
								information
								from the news, and power the lights in their home through a few minutes of simple pedaling.
							</p>

							<p>Our product was also designed to support the struggle to end global warming which is a prevalent issue in
								modern
								society. By purchasing this bike, you are taking steps to establish your independence from fossil fuels which
								are
								still used to fuel most of the energy used in the electric grid in the United States. This device allows you to
								produce clean energy without the production of any harmful pollution commonly associated with fossil fuels.
								This
								product is not just an exercise bike designed to store and output electricity; it is also meant to be your
								first step
								towards building the future powered by renewable energy sources.
