								<p>The machine was designed after a stationary exercise bike. Inside its casing is a gearbox, an electrical
									dynamo, and
									a battery. At the front of the machine is an LCD screen that displays a variety of useful information relating
									to its
									power output. Aside from converting a user’s energy into usable electricity, the machine’s main purpose is to
									make the
									user more aware of the source of the electricity that their life is dependent on. The machine accomplishes
									this—physically and visually—by showing the user how energy is converted from one form into another, more
									useful form.
									Additionally, the machine serves to aid the user with grounding and internalizing the concept of electricity,
									while
									also developing their understanding of the true scale of our country’s electricity usage from both an
									individual and
									national perspective.
								</p>

								<p>As humans continue to advance the frontier of technology, energy has become an essential element of our
									lives.
									Energy, especially in the form of electricity, has allowed humans to be productive for more hours of the day,
									to
									communicate over long distances, and to design rockets that have reached the Moon, among other amazing feats.
									Greater
									control of energy has revolutionized all sectors of human affairs, including economics, international culture,
									academics, and medicine. Yet, many people still don’t understand how energy moves throughout our daily lives
									because
									developers of modern technologies believe it unnecessary to highlight how energy is utilized within their
									device. </p>

								<p> product seeks to challenge this by making its energy input readily apparent, while still remaining
									efficient
									and
									functional. We firmly believe that the Electricycle will change how its users think about the energy they use
									in their
									daily lives through its presentation of energy consumption in terms of everyday activities. We hope you will
									enjoy our
									product and “supercharge your health as you fuel your home”. </p>

							<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Real World Applications</h2>
							<p>Our product would be extremely beneficial in regions affected by natural disasters. Although there is labor
								involved, the price gap between our product and other generators is significant enough to make taking the time
								to
								pedal worth it. Additionally, third-world countries could greatly benefit from our product. Those who are in
								need of
								energy can have it after a short period of pedaling, without the need for natural resources to power our
								generator.
								This results in a lack of additional costs typically associated with other forms of energy production, and it
								is
								sustainable enough to take care of everyday needs. Yet another application is the generation of power during a
								blackout (caused by severe weather). One could quickly create enough energy to power the necessary devices to
								survive
								inclement weather, be it getting information from the news or staying warm with your central heating system..
